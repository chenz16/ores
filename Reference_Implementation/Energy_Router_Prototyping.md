# Energy Router Prototyping (Initial)

## Specification: Energy Router and Architecture (value proposition)

In addition to the **Open Standardization** for the current mainstream production, we propose the next generation **AC Battery** technology-based disruptive Home Grid integration system with the concept of **Energy Router** as the fundamental architecture and implementation solution. We will provide more architecture update with specification section.

1. Power Plane (Energy Distribution)

- Major features for power plane are AC coupling, DC coupling or hybrid, and AC Battery technology based. We can combine, configure these features together as Energy Router Model for various scenario. For example, if solar is too far we'd better use AC coupling; if it is closer and more powerful we can use DC coupling hybrid. It supports both off grid and grid tie application. We can use grid utility to charge extra for off grid system if solar doesn't generate enough. These are illustration diagrams mainly of power plane. 
- Split Phase: specific for US application. 
- Off Grid, Grid Tie, and "Grid Forming": Current off grid system solution has a AC input for battery charging from grid. It is treated as kind of a load of grid. Similarly, the off grid can be a generator this way for grid. We can call it a coupling of DC battery. The eventual general solution probably the grid tie system, the energy flow between is controlled by the EMS. We use the grid forming solution as the reference model for the interaction between the home grid and the utility grid. 

2. Control Plane (SDER - Software Defined Energy Router)
- Dis-aggregate: compared with proprietary hybrid product solution. 
- Distributed: not only devices, but also smart plug sensors and switches. 
- Centralized: information and management mechanism with the CCU.
- Multiple layer: one is at system wise CCU, the other is at smart device

- Use resister for device capacitor charge when connect battery first time to avoid spark.
- Central air conditioner with soft starter, for surge capacity.
