# Reference Implementation

## LF Energy Summit 2024 Presentation
1. Speaker (**Solution**): The Future of Energy with Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES)
- Standardization, problem driven.
- Dis-aggregate, Smart Panel (generation vs consumption, view vs control).
- Home Grid: microgrid for smart home, grid technologies down sizing. 
- Layers: device, platform, application.

2. Project Demo (**Implementation**): Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) 
- Development setup, based on Home Assistant and ESPHome, real time remote browser access, one setup in China another in California.
