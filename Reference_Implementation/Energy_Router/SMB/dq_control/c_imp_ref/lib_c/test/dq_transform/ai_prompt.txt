Please write C code to test the dq_transform_1phase.h file.

Test Requirements:
1. Input Signals:
   - Signal A: Sine wave
     * Frequency: 50 Hz
     * Sampling rate: 1 kHz (1000 samples/second)
     * Amplitude: 1.0 (or specify desired amplitude)
   - Signal B: Phase angle
     * Matching 50 Hz rotation
     * Range: 0 to 2Ï€

2. Test Cases:
   a) Steady-state test:
      - Generate 0.1 seconds of data (100 samples)
      - Verify d,q outputs are constant for matched frequency

   b) Phase offset test:
      - Test with different phase offsets between input and angle
      - Expected: Different steady-state d,q values

3. Expected Outputs:
   - d-component: Direct axis value
   - q-component: Quadrature axis value
   - Plot or print results for verification

4. Verification:
   - For matched frequency and phase:
     * One component should be maximum
     * Other component should be near zero
