create a test case for notch filter with 50Hz and 2 - 6th harmonics
1. input signal is 50Hz sine wave with 2 - 6th harmonics
2. sampling frequency is 1000Hz
3. print the time and amplitude of the input and output signals through terminal and save to a file
4. plot the time domain and frequency domain of the input and output signals
