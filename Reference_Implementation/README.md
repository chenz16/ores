# Reference Implementation

## LF Energy Summit 2024 Presentation
1. Speaker (Solution): The Future of Energy with Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES)
- Standardization, problem driven.
- Dis-aggregate, Smart Panel (generation vs consumption, view vs control).
- Home Grid: microgrid for smart home, grid technologies down sizing. 
- Layers: device, platform, application.

2. Project Demo (Implementation): Open Renewable Energy Systems (ORES) 
- Development setup, based on Home Assistant and ESPHome, real time remote browser access, one setup in China another in California.
- Production setup with third party kit, short video.
- On site AC Battery empty box. how to ship to the summit?

3. Panel (Future): mainly introduce the AC battery based ESS disruptive innovation "Energy Router" initiative
- SMB: Multilevel modular PCS.
- Better safety, lower cost, higher efficiency.

## Existing technology and vendor solution integration
