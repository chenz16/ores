design a single phase dq controller to regulate the current from an invreter to the grid
the controller should be able to follow the grid voltage and phase to preduce the desired current


Assume we know:
1. the desired current to be injected into the grid or the current drawn from the grid
2. the grid magnitude voltage and phase measured at the inverter output
3. estimated d, q components of the inverter output current
