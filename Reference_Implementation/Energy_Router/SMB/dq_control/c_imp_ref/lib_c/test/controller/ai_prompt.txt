Design a Python simulation for a single-phase grid-connected inverter controller system.

System Requirements:
1. Core Components:
   - Controller (PI or PR controller)
   - RL load (specify values: R = X ohm, L = Y mH)
   - Grid voltage source (220V RMS, 50Hz)
   - Current measurement system

2. Operating Conditions:
   - Grid: 220V RMS, 50Hz
   - Current convention: Positive when inverter injects current into grid
   - System should operate in dq reference frame
   - Reference tracking for both voltage and current

3. Timing Parameters:
   - Simulation sampling time: 10Âµs (100kHz)
   - Controller execution rate: 1kHz (every 100 simulation steps)

4. System Disturbances:
   - Grid harmonics: 3rd and 5th order
   - Voltage actuator noise: 100Hz component
   - Specify amplitude of harmonics and noise (e.g., 3% of fundamental)

Required Outputs:
1. Time-domain plots:
   - Grid voltage and current
   - Controller response
   - Error signals

2. Frequency-domain analysis:
   - FFT spectrum of voltage and current
   - THD calculations

Additional Requirements:
1. Include comments explaining the control strategy
2. Provide tuning parameters for the controller
3. Show steady-state and transient response
4. Include performance metrics (e.g., settling time, steady-state error)

Please provide the simulation code with clear documentation and results analysis.
